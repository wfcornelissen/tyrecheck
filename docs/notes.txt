With the dbInterRef branch I am trying to keep any changes to attributes in entries and any database interactions in dbFuncs.
This way it becomes easier to debug and maintain (I hope)
Furthermore I am trying to remove as much logic from cmd as possible. This will drastically imporve maintainability in case commands need to be changed.


When working with fit function, keep in mind var1, var2 = var2, var1 type logic
