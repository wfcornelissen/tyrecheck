With the dbInterRef branch I am trying to keep any changes to attributes in entries and any database interactions in dbFuncs.
This way it becomes easier to debug and maintain (I hope)
Furthermore I am trying to remove as much logic from cmd as possible. This will drastically imporve maintainability in case commands need to be changed.
