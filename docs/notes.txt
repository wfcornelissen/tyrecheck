With the dbInterRef branch I am trying to keep any changes to attributes in entries and any database interactions in dbFuncs.
This way it becomes easier to debug and maintain (I hope)
Furthermore I am trying to remove as much logic from cmd as possible. This will drastically imporve maintainability in case commands need to be changed.


When working with fit function, keep in mind var1, var2 = var2, var1 type logic

When referring to new structure (one implemented using dbInterRef branch) it refers to:
    -   Commands purely calling functions that on their own interact with the user if needed
    -   Entries (funcs referred to in first bullet) purely being used for user interaction and contains no db interaction
    -   db interactions encapsulated? to dbFuncs package.
